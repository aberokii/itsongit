## GET /v1/queue/next-slot

**Get next available slot**

Returns the next available queue slot for preview purposes. To create a queue post, use POST /v1/posts with queuedFromProfile instead of scheduledFor.

### Parameters

- **profileId** (required) in query: No description
- **queueId** (optional) in query: Specific queue ID (optional, defaults to profile's default queue)

### Responses

#### 200: Next available slot

**Response Body:**

- **profileId** `string`: No description
- **nextSlot** `string` (date-time): No description
- **timezone** `string`: No description
- **queueId** `string`: Queue ID this slot belongs to
- **queueName** `string`: Queue name

#### 400: Invalid parameters or inactive queue

#### 401: Missing or invalid API key. `code` is `missing_credentials` when no Authorization header was sent and `invalid_credentials` when the key is unknown, revoked or expired.

**Response Body:**

- **error** `string`: Human-readable error message.
- **type** `string`: Error class for programmatic handling. - one of: invalid_request_error, authentication_error, permission_error, not_found, rate_limit_error, platform_error, api_error
- **code** `string`: Stable machine-readable error code.
- **param** `string`: The request field that caused the error, when applicable.
- **docUrl** `string`: Documentation page for resolving the error, when one applies.
- **platform** `string`: Upstream platform (e.g. meta, google, tiktok), present when type is platform_error.
- **platformError** `object`: Raw error payload from the upstream platform, passed through verbatim so
integrators can read provider-specific codes. For Meta this includes
error_subcode, error_user_title, and error_user_msg.

- **details** `object`: Additional structured context (e.g. field-level validation errors), for example
`privateReplyConsumed` on the private-reply endpoint's 400 when the comment's
single reply is already spent, and `privateReplyOutcome: "unknown"` on its 502 when Meta
answered a server error and the reply may have been delivered.

On a Google Ads 429 it carries `quotaExhausted: true`, which marks the failure as
Google's own ads quota rather than a Zernio rate limit, so you can keep calling
other platforms instead of backing off everywhere. When Google names the scope it
also carries `quotaScope`: `DEVELOPER` means the shared developer-token budget
(every Google account is affected and there is nothing to change on your side),
`ACCOUNT` means your own ad account. A Meta 429 carries neither field.

A Zernio Google Ads burst-limit 429 carries `budgetScope` instead, and never
`quotaExhausted`: these are Zernio's own limits, applied before the call
reaches Google, and both clear within a minute. `account` is the limit of 15
requests per minute per connected Google Ads account; `user` is the ceiling of
120 requests per minute per Zernio user across all their Google Ads accounts.
Both are separate axes from `quotaScope`, not the same pool named twice.

A failed Meta ad create (`POST /v1/ads/create`, `POST /v1/ads/boost`,
`POST /v1/ads/ctwa`) carries `stage`, `adAccountId` and `createdObjects`: where
it failed, on which ad account, and every object this request had already
created with what cleanup did to it. `left_behind` objects still exist on the
ad account (Meta refused the delete, typically on a held account), so delete
them yourself or reuse them. `unconfirmedWrite` is set when Meta answered a
create with a 5xx or dropped the connection and Zernio could not confirm
whether the object exists: check that parent before creating it again.

When Meta refuses a write because the ad account's status is ineligible to manage
ads (Meta subcode 2490592 or 4841021, on the write itself or on a cleanup delete),
any Meta ads write (create, boost, CTWA, campaign / ad set / ad updates and status
changes) answers 422 `ad_account_unusable`. The message names the ad account when
known, links Meta's fix (https://www.facebook.com/business/help/422289316306981),
lists the objects left behind and ends with Meta's original error, which also stays
verbatim in `platformError`. Meta often reports the first failure under an
unrelated code (e.g. 1487194 on the creative), so branch on `code`, not on
`platformError`.

  - **stage** `string`: Meta ad create failures only. The step that failed: `media` (image/video download or upload), `campaign`, `adset`, `creative`, `ad` (the ad POST itself, where Meta's code 31 / 3858385 hold and 100 / 1359188 payment rejections land), `activation` (switching the created objects on), or `other` (a read or check before any write). - one of: media, campaign, adset, creative, ad, activation, other
  - **adAccountId** `string`: Meta ad create failures only. The ad account the request wrote to (`act_...`).
  - **createdObjects** `array[object]`: Meta ad create failures only. Every object this request created before failing, in creation order. Objects you referenced (an existing campaign, ad set, creative or video) are never listed and never deleted.
    - **type** `string`: No description - one of: campaign, adset, creative, ad, video, image
    - **id** `string`: Meta object id; for `image` the image hash.
    - **cleanup** `string`: `deleted`: Zernio deleted it. `left_behind`: Meta refused the delete, so it still exists. `kept`: deliberately not deleted (image hashes are shared by every upload of the same file). - one of: deleted, left_behind, kept
  - **unconfirmedWrite** `object`: Meta ad create failures only, when Meta answered a create with a 5xx or dropped the connection and the object could not be looked up. Zernio did not retry it.
    - **type** `string`: No description - one of: campaign, adset, creative, ad
    - **parentId** `string`: Where to look for it: the ad set for an ad, the campaign for an ad set, the ad account otherwise.
  - **quotaExhausted** `boolean`: Google Ads 429 only. True when the upstream Google Ads quota is spent rather than a Zernio limit.
  - **quotaScope** `string`: Google Ads 429 only, when Google names the scope. DEVELOPER is the shared developer-token budget; ACCOUNT is your ad account. - one of: DEVELOPER, ACCOUNT
  - **budgetScope** `string`: Zernio Google Ads burst-limit 429 only (never set alongside `quotaExhausted`). `account` is the limit of 15 requests per minute per connected Google Ads account; `user` is the ceiling of 120 requests per minute per Zernio user across all their Google Ads accounts. Both clear within a minute. - one of: account, user

#### 404: Profile or queue schedule not found, or no available slots

## ErrorResponse

Canonical error envelope. `error` is the human-readable message; `type`,
`code`, `param`, `platform`, and `platformError` are top-level siblings
for programmatic handling. For upstream platform failures (`type:
platform_error`), `platformError` carries the provider's raw payload
verbatim (for Meta: `error_subcode`, `error_user_title`, `error_user_msg`).
