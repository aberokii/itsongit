# Get Instagram follower history API Reference

Returns a daily running Instagram follower count time series, served from Zernio's
cross-platform daily snapshotter. Exists because Meta removed follower_count from
the /insights endpoint in Graph API v22+ and never exposed a historical daily series
via any public API.

Response envelope matches /v1/analytics/instagram/account-insights so the same client
handling works. Max 89 days, defaults to last 30 days. Requires the Analytics add-on.

**Get Instagram follower history**

Returns a daily running Instagram follower count time series, served from Zernio's
cross-platform daily snapshotter. Exists because Meta removed follower_count from
the /insights endpoint in Graph API v22+ and never exposed a historical daily series
via any public API.

Response envelope matches /v1/analytics/instagram/account-insights so the same client
handling works. Max 89 days, defaults to last 30 days. Requires the Analytics add-on.


### Parameters

- **accountId** (required) in query: The Zernio SocialAccount ID for the Instagram account.
- **metrics** (optional) in query: Comma-separated list. Defaults to "follower_count,followers_gained,followers_lost".
  - follower_count   : per-day raw follower count
  - followers_gained : sum of positive daily deltas
  - followers_lost   : sum of absolute negative daily deltas

- **fromDate** (optional) in query: Start date (YYYY-MM-DD). Defaults to 30 days ago.
- **toDate** (optional) in query: End date (YYYY-MM-DD). Defaults to today.
- **since** (optional) in query: Alias of fromDate, kept for existing callers
- **until** (optional) in query: Alias of toDate, kept for existing callers
- **metricType** (optional) in query: "total_value" returns aggregated totals (latest for follower_count, sum for gained/lost).
"time_series" returns per-day values in the "values" array.


### Responses

#### 200: Follower history data

**Response Body:**

- **success** `boolean`: No description (example: true)
- **accountId** `string`: The Zernio SocialAccount ID
- **platform** `string`: Platform that served this response. - one of: facebook, instagram, youtube, linkedin, tiktok
- **dateRange** `object`: 
  - **since** `string` (date): No description
  - **until** `string` (date): No description
- **metricType** `string`: No description - one of: time_series, total_value
- **breakdown** `string`: Breakdown dimension used (only present when breakdown was requested)
- **metrics** `object`: Object keyed by metric name. For time_series: each metric has "total" (number) and "values" (array of {date, value}).
For total_value: each metric has "total" (number) and optionally "breakdowns" (array of {dimension, value}).

Monetary metrics additionally carry "unit" and "currency". Zernio never rescales money:
"total" and every "values[].value" are the platform's raw numbers in the stated unit.
Monetary metrics also keep "values" on metricType=total_value, because their "total" is the
sum of the daily buckets the platform returned over the range: keep the series so you can
reconcile that sum against the platform's own reporting before invoicing on it.
A metric that could not be served is absent from this object and listed in
"unavailableMetrics" instead, so an unavailable metric is never reported as a zero.

- **unavailableMetrics** `array[object]`: Requested metrics that could not be served. Present only when at least one metric is
unavailable, and absent otherwise. Each listed metric is OMITTED from "metrics" rather than
reported as 0, which is how an unavailable metric is distinguished from a genuine zero.
The request itself still succeeds with HTTP 200.

  - **metric** `string`: The requested metric name.
  - **reason** `string`: "not_enrolled": the account is not enrolled in the program behind this metric.
"permission_missing": the connected user lacks access to this metric.
"unsupported_metric": the platform does not accept this metric name on the API version Zernio uses.
"no_data": the platform returned no bucket for this metric over the requested range.
"unreadable_value": the platform returned a value shape Zernio cannot read, so no total is reported.
"mixed_currency": readable values disagree on currency or unit within the range.
"upstream_error": any other platform failure.

"no_data" is the common case in practice. The others are defensive: "not_enrolled" and
"unsupported_metric" in particular have not been observed on live Facebook traffic, since
a non-enrolled Page returns zeros rather than an error and metric names are validated
before any platform call.
 - one of: not_enrolled, permission_missing, unsupported_metric, no_data, unreadable_value, mixed_currency, upstream_error
  - **message** `string`: Platform-provided explanation when available (access tokens redacted), otherwise Zernio copy.
- **dataDelay** `string`: No description (example: "Data may be delayed up to 48 hours")

#### 400: Bad request (invalid accountId / metrics / date range, or account is not an Instagram account)

#### 401: Missing or invalid API key. `code` is `missing_credentials` when no Authorization header was sent and `invalid_credentials` when the key is unknown, revoked or expired.

**Response Body:**

- **error** `string`: Human-readable error message.
- **type** `string`: Error class for programmatic handling. - one of: invalid_request_error, authentication_error, permission_error, not_found, rate_limit_error, platform_error, api_error
- **code** `string`: Stable machine-readable error code.
- **param** `string`: The request field that caused the error, when applicable.
- **docUrl** `string`: Documentation page for resolving the error, when one applies.
- **platform** `string`: Upstream platform (e.g. meta, google, tiktok), present when type is platform_error.
- **platformError** `object`: Raw error payload from the upstream platform, passed through verbatim so
integrators can read provider-specific codes. For Meta this includes
error_subcode, error_user_title, and error_user_msg.

- **details** `object`: Additional structured context (e.g. field-level validation errors), for example
`privateReplyConsumed` on the private-reply endpoint's 400 when the comment's
single reply is already spent, and `privateReplyOutcome: "unknown"` on its 502 when Meta
answered a server error and the reply may have been delivered.

On a Google Ads 429 it carries `quotaExhausted: true`, which marks the failure as
Google's own ads quota rather than a Zernio rate limit, so you can keep calling
other platforms instead of backing off everywhere. When Google names the scope it
also carries `quotaScope`: `DEVELOPER` means the shared developer-token budget
(every Google account is affected and there is nothing to change on your side),
`ACCOUNT` means your own ad account. A Meta 429 carries neither field.

A Zernio Google Ads burst-limit 429 carries `budgetScope` instead, and never
`quotaExhausted`: these are Zernio's own limits, applied before the call
reaches Google, and both clear within a minute. `account` is the limit of 15
requests per minute per connected Google Ads account; `user` is the ceiling of
120 requests per minute per Zernio user across all their Google Ads accounts.
Both are separate axes from `quotaScope`, not the same pool named twice.

A failed Meta ad create (`POST /v1/ads/create`, `POST /v1/ads/boost`,
`POST /v1/ads/ctwa`) carries `stage`, `adAccountId` and `createdObjects`: where
it failed, on which ad account, and every object this request had already
created with what cleanup did to it. `left_behind` objects still exist on the
ad account (Meta refused the delete, typically on a held account), so delete
them yourself or reuse them. `unconfirmedWrite` is set when Meta answered a
create with a 5xx or dropped the connection and Zernio could not confirm
whether the object exists: check that parent before creating it again.

When Meta refuses a write because the ad account's status is ineligible to manage
ads (Meta subcode 2490592 or 4841021, on the write itself or on a cleanup delete),
any Meta ads write (create, boost, CTWA, campaign / ad set / ad updates and status
changes) answers 422 `ad_account_unusable`. The message names the ad account when
known, links Meta's fix (https://www.facebook.com/business/help/422289316306981),
lists the objects left behind and ends with Meta's original error, which also stays
verbatim in `platformError`. Meta often reports the first failure under an
unrelated code (e.g. 1487194 on the creative), so branch on `code`, not on
`platformError`.

  - **stage** `string`: Meta ad create failures only. The step that failed: `media` (image/video download or upload), `campaign`, `adset`, `creative`, `ad` (the ad POST itself, where Meta's code 31 / 3858385 hold and 100 / 1359188 payment rejections land), `activation` (switching the created objects on), or `other` (a read or check before any write). - one of: media, campaign, adset, creative, ad, activation, other
  - **adAccountId** `string`: Meta ad create failures only. The ad account the request wrote to (`act_...`).
  - **createdObjects** `array[object]`: Meta ad create failures only. Every object this request created before failing, in creation order. Objects you referenced (an existing campaign, ad set, creative or video) are never listed and never deleted.
    - **type** `string`: No description - one of: campaign, adset, creative, ad, video, image
    - **id** `string`: Meta object id; for `image` the image hash.
    - **cleanup** `string`: `deleted`: Zernio deleted it. `left_behind`: Meta refused the delete, so it still exists. `kept`: deliberately not deleted (image hashes are shared by every upload of the same file). - one of: deleted, left_behind, kept
  - **unconfirmedWrite** `object`: Meta ad create failures only, when Meta answered a create with a 5xx or dropped the connection and the object could not be looked up. Zernio did not retry it.
    - **type** `string`: No description - one of: campaign, adset, creative, ad
    - **parentId** `string`: Where to look for it: the ad set for an ad, the campaign for an ad set, the ad account otherwise.
  - **quotaExhausted** `boolean`: Google Ads 429 only. True when the upstream Google Ads quota is spent rather than a Zernio limit.
  - **quotaScope** `string`: Google Ads 429 only, when Google names the scope. DEVELOPER is the shared developer-token budget; ACCOUNT is your ad account. - one of: DEVELOPER, ACCOUNT
  - **budgetScope** `string`: Zernio Google Ads burst-limit 429 only (never set alongside `quotaExhausted`). `account` is the limit of 15 requests per minute per connected Google Ads account; `user` is the ceiling of 120 requests per minute per Zernio user across all their Google Ads accounts. Both clear within a minute. - one of: account, user

#### 402: Analytics access required. Legacy plans need the Analytics add-on; included by default on usage-based plans.

#### 404: Account not found

## InstagramAccountInsightsResponse

Shared account-insights response envelope used by every platform-level
analytics endpoint (/v1/analytics/{facebook|instagram|youtube|linkedin|tiktok}/*).
The name is historical - the shape was first shipped for Instagram and every
new platform endpoint reuses it for response-shape consistency. The platform
field echoes back which platform served the response.

## ErrorResponse

Canonical error envelope. `error` is the human-readable message; `type`,
`code`, `param`, `platform`, and `platformError` are top-level siblings
for programmatic handling. For upstream platform failures (`type:
platform_error`), `platformError` carries the provider's raw payload
verbatim (for Meta: `error_subcode`, `error_user_title`, `error_user_msg`).


### Properties
