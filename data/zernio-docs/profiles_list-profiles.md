# List profiles API Reference

Returns profiles sorted default-first, then by creation date. Filter with name or externalId (exact match) and paginate with limit/skip; without those params the full list is returned unchanged. Use includeOverLimit=true to include profiles that exceed the plan limit.

## GET /v1/profiles

**List profiles**

Returns profiles sorted default-first, then by creation date. Filter with name or externalId (exact match) and paginate with limit/skip; without those params the full list is returned unchanged. Use includeOverLimit=true to include profiles that exceed the plan limit.

### Parameters

- **includeOverLimit** (optional) in query: When true, includes over-limit profiles (marked with isOverLimit: true).
- **name** (optional) in query: Exact-match filter on the profile name. Useful to recover a profile id after an ambiguous create (timeout followed by a 409 on retry).
- **externalId** (optional) in query: Exact-match filter on the externalId you set on the profile, to find the profile of one of your tenants without storing its Zernio id. Team members can each own a profile with the same externalId, so the result is a list.
- **limit** (optional) in query: Page size. When limit or skip is present, the response includes total and skip (and echoes limit).
- **skip** (optional) in query: Number of profiles to skip, applied after sorting and filtering.

### Responses

#### 200: Profiles

**Response Body:**

- **profiles** `array[Profile]`: 
- **total** `integer`: Total matching profiles across all pages. Present only when limit or skip was passed.
- **skip** `integer`: Offset applied. Present only when limit or skip was passed.
- **limit** `integer`: Echo of the limit query param. Present only when it was passed.

#### 400: Invalid request

**Response Body:**

- **error** `string`: Human-readable error message.
- **type** `string`: Error class for programmatic handling. - one of: invalid_request_error, authentication_error, permission_error, not_found, rate_limit_error, platform_error, api_error
- **code** `string`: Stable machine-readable error code.
- **param** `string`: The request field that caused the error, when applicable.
- **docUrl** `string`: Documentation page for resolving the error, when one applies.
- **platform** `string`: Upstream platform (e.g. meta, google, tiktok), present when type is platform_error.
- **platformError** `object`: Raw error payload from the upstream platform, passed through verbatim so
integrators can read provider-specific codes. For Meta this includes
error_subcode, error_user_title, and error_user_msg.

- **details** `object`: Additional structured context (e.g. field-level validation errors), for example
`privateReplyConsumed` on the private-reply endpoint's 400 when the comment's
single reply is already spent, and `privateReplyOutcome: "unknown"` on its 502 when Meta
answered a server error and the reply may have been delivered.

On a Google Ads 429 it carries `quotaExhausted: true`, which marks the failure as
Google's own ads quota rather than a Zernio rate limit, so you can keep calling
other platforms instead of backing off everywhere. When Google names the scope it
also carries `quotaScope`: `DEVELOPER` means the shared developer-token budget
(every Google account is affected and there is nothing to change on your side),
`ACCOUNT` means your own ad account. A Meta 429 carries neither field.

A Zernio Google Ads burst-limit 429 carries `budgetScope` instead, and never
`quotaExhausted`: these are Zernio's own limits, applied before the call
reaches Google, and both clear within a minute. `account` is the limit of 15
requests per minute per connected Google Ads account; `user` is the ceiling of
120 requests per minute per Zernio user across all their Google Ads accounts.
Both are separate axes from `quotaScope`, not the same pool named twice.

A failed Meta ad create (`POST /v1/ads/create`, `POST /v1/ads/boost`,
`POST /v1/ads/ctwa`) carries `stage`, `adAccountId` and `createdObjects`: where
it failed, on which ad account, and every object this request had already
created with what cleanup did to it. `left_behind` objects still exist on the
ad account (Meta refused the delete, typically on a held account), so delete
them yourself or reuse them. `unconfirmedWrite` is set when Meta answered a
create with a 5xx or dropped the connection and Zernio could not confirm
whether the object exists: check that parent before creating it again.

When Meta refuses a write because the ad account's status is ineligible to manage
ads (Meta subcode 2490592 or 4841021, on the write itself or on a cleanup delete),
any Meta ads write (create, boost, CTWA, campaign / ad set / ad updates and status
changes) answers 422 `ad_account_unusable`. The message names the ad account when
known, links Meta's fix (https://www.facebook.com/business/help/422289316306981),
lists the objects left behind and ends with Meta's original error, which also stays
verbatim in `platformError`. Meta often reports the first failure under an
unrelated code (e.g. 1487194 on the creative), so branch on `code`, not on
`platformError`.

  - **stage** `string`: Meta ad create failures only. The step that failed: `media` (image/video download or upload), `campaign`, `adset`, `creative`, `ad` (the ad POST itself, where Meta's code 31 / 3858385 hold and 100 / 1359188 payment rejections land), `activation` (switching the created objects on), or `other` (a read or check before any write). - one of: media, campaign, adset, creative, ad, activation, other
  - **adAccountId** `string`: Meta ad create failures only. The ad account the request wrote to (`act_...`).
  - **createdObjects** `array[object]`: Meta ad create failures only. Every object this request created before failing, in creation order. Objects you referenced (an existing campaign, ad set, creative or video) are never listed and never deleted.
    - **type** `string`: No description - one of: campaign, adset, creative, ad, video, image
    - **id** `string`: Meta object id; for `image` the image hash.
    - **cleanup** `string`: `deleted`: Zernio deleted it. `left_behind`: Meta refused the delete, so it still exists. `kept`: deliberately not deleted (image hashes are shared by every upload of the same file). - one of: deleted, left_behind, kept
  - **unconfirmedWrite** `object`: Meta ad create failures only, when Meta answered a create with a 5xx or dropped the connection and the object could not be looked up. Zernio did not retry it.
    - **type** `string`: No description - one of: campaign, adset, creative, ad
    - **parentId** `string`: Where to look for it: the ad set for an ad, the campaign for an ad set, the ad account otherwise.
  - **quotaExhausted** `boolean`: Google Ads 429 only. True when the upstream Google Ads quota is spent rather than a Zernio limit.
  - **quotaScope** `string`: Google Ads 429 only, when Google names the scope. DEVELOPER is the shared developer-token budget; ACCOUNT is your ad account. - one of: DEVELOPER, ACCOUNT
  - **budgetScope** `string`: Zernio Google Ads burst-limit 429 only (never set alongside `quotaExhausted`). `account` is the limit of 15 requests per minute per connected Google Ads account; `user` is the ceiling of 120 requests per minute per Zernio user across all their Google Ads accounts. Both clear within a minute. - one of: account, user

#### 401: Missing or invalid API key. `code` is `missing_credentials` when no Authorization header was sent and `invalid_credentials` when the key is unknown, revoked or expired.

**Response Body:**

- **error** `string`: Human-readable error message.
- **type** `string`: Error class for programmatic handling. - one of: invalid_request_error, authentication_error, permission_error, not_found, rate_limit_error, platform_error, api_error

A failed Meta ad create (`POST /v1/ads/create`, `POST /v1/ads/boost`,
`POST /v1/ads/ctwa`) carries `stage`, `adAccountId` and `createdObjects`: where

## POST /v1/profiles

**Create profile**

Creates a new profile with a name, optional description, and color. Names are unique per team: a duplicate returns a 409 whose details.existingProfileId carries the id of the existing profile. Set externalId to your own tenant or client id to find the profile later without storing its Zernio id. A duplicate externalId returns the same kind of 409, with code profile_external_id_conflict. Send an Idempotency-Key header to make retries safe: a retried create with the same key and body replays the original 201 (same _id) instead of conflicting.

### Parameters

- **undefined** (optional): No description

### Request Body

- **name** (required) `string`: No description
- **description** `string`: No description
- **color** `string`: No description
- **timezone** `string`: IANA timezone new posts on this profile use when they name no `timezone`. Omit to keep UTC. An unknown name returns 400.
- **externalId** `string`: Your own identifier for this profile, typically the id of the tenant or client it serves in your system (1 to 255 characters, trimmed). Unique among the profiles of the user who owns the profile: a duplicate returns 409 profile_external_id_conflict. Look a profile up by it with GET /v1/profiles?externalId=.

### Responses

#### 402: Payment method or enterprise contract required. The authenticated
account hit a billing gate before the connection could proceed.
Three reasons:

  - `free_tier_exceeded`: the team has connected more accounts
    than the free tier allows. Add a payment method on the
    dashboard to continue (the user will be billed per
    additional connected account).

  - `twitter_passthrough`: connecting an X account
    requires a card on file from day one because X API calls
    incur real per-call pass-through costs. Applies to the 1st
    X account, not only the 3rd+.

  - `enterprise_required`: the team is on an enterprise
    contract with a negotiated connected-account cap and has
    reached it. Self-service teams have NO connected-account cap (the
    $1/account rate continues at any scale), so this reason can
    only fire for teams whose contract sets an explicit limit.
    `dashboard_url` deep-links to the enterprise contact page
    rather than the billing tab. The end-user already has a
    card on file; this gate is about contract terms, not card
    collection.

  - `card_verification_required`: the card on file was flagged
    at add time (prepaid, or issued in a different country than
    the billing address) and a one-time verification charge of
    `details.verification_amount_cents` (USD) is pending. The
    charge is credited to the team's usage balance, not a fee.
    `dashboard_url` opens the billing page on the verification
    step; the request succeeds once it is paid.

SDK consumers should switch on `reason` to render the right
prompt. For `free_tier_exceeded`, `twitter_passthrough` and
`card_verification_required`, redirect the end-user to
`dashboard_url`: it opens the add-payment-method drawer on the
Zernio billing page, and the request succeeds once the card is
on file (or verified). For `enterprise_required`, redirect to
`dashboard_url` (the enterprise contact form) to adjust the
contract's limit.


**Response Body:**

- **error** (required) `string`: Human-readable error message suitable for end-user display. (example: "X (Twitter) requires a payment method due to API pass-through costs. Add a payment method to connect an X account.")
- **code** (required) `string`: Machine-readable error code. Stable across versions. - one of: PAYMENT_REQUIRED
- **reason** (required) `string`: Discriminator for which gate fired. - one of: free_tier_exceeded, twitter_passthrough, enterprise_required, card_verification_required
- **documentation_url** `string` (uri): Link to the relevant documentation page. (example: "https://docs.zernio.com/billing/payment-method-required")
- **dashboard_url** `string` (uri): Deep-link to send the end-user to. For
`free_tier_exceeded` and `twitter_passthrough` this opens
the add-payment-method drawer on the Zernio billing page.
For `enterprise_required` this is the Zernio enterprise
contact page.
 (example: "https://zernio.com/dashboard/billing?add_payment_method=1")
- **details** `object`: Structured context for SDK clients that want to render their own UX. Keys vary by `reason`.
  - **free_tier_account_limit** `integer`: How many accounts the free tier allows. Only set when reason=free_tier_exceeded. (example: 2)
  - **current_account_count** `integer`: How many accounts the team currently has connected. Set when reason=free_tier_exceeded or reason=enterprise_required. (example: 5)
  - **has_payment_method** `boolean`: Whether the team currently has a card on file in Stripe. Set when reason=free_tier_exceeded or reason=twitter_passthrough.
  - **verification_amount_cents** `integer`: One-time card verification charge in USD cents, credited to usage. Only set when reason=card_verification_required. (example: 1000)
  - **effective_account_limit** `integer`: The negotiated connected-account cap from the
team's enterprise contract. Self-service teams
have no cap and never receive this reason. Only
set when reason=enterprise_required.
 (example: 2000)

#### 403: Profile limit exceeded

#### 409: A profile with this name (code: profile_name_conflict) or this externalId (code: profile_external_id_conflict) already exists; details.existingProfileId carries the id of the existing profile. Also returned while a request with the same Idempotency-Key is still processing.

#### 422: Idempotency-Key reused with a different request

## ErrorResponse

Canonical error envelope. `error` is the human-readable message; `type`,
`code`, `param`, `platform`, and `platformError` are top-level siblings
for programmatic handling. For upstream platform failures (`type:
platform_error`), `platformError` carries the provider's raw payload
verbatim (for Meta: `error_subcode`, `error_user_title`, `error_user_msg`).


### Properties

- **error** `string`: Human-readable error message.
- **type** `string`: Error class for programmatic handling. - one of: invalid_request_error, authentication_error, permission_error, not_found, rate_limit_error, platform_error, api_error
- **code** `string`: Stable machine-readable error code.
- **param** `string`: The request field that caused the error, when applicable.
- **docUrl** `string`: Documentation page for resolving the error, when one applies.
- **platform** `string`: Upstream platform (e.g. meta, google, tiktok), present when type is platform_error.
- **platformError** `object`: Raw error payload from the upstream platform, passed through verbatim so
integrators can read provider-specific codes. For Meta this includes
error_subcode, error_user_title, and error_user_msg.

- **details** `object`: Additional structured context (e.g. field-level validation errors), for example
`privateReplyConsumed` on the private-reply endpoint's 400 when the comment's
single reply is already spent, and `privateReplyOutcome: "unknown"` on its 502 when Meta
answered a server error and the reply may have been delivered.

On a Google Ads 429 it carries `quotaExhausted: true`, which marks the failure as
Google's own ads quota rather than a Zernio rate limit, so you can keep calling
other platforms instead of backing off everywhere. When Google names the scope it
also carries `quotaScope`: `DEVELOPER` means the shared developer-token budget
(every Google account is affected and there is nothing to change on your side),
`ACCOUNT` means your own ad account. A Meta 429 carries neither field.

A Zernio Google Ads burst-limit 429 carries `budgetScope` instead, and never
`quotaExhausted`: these are Zernio's own limits, applied before the call
reaches Google, and both clear within a minute. `account` is the limit of 15
requests per minute per connected Google Ads account; `user` is the ceiling of
120 requests per minute per Zernio user across all their Google Ads accounts.
Both are separate axes from `quotaScope`, not the same pool named twice.

A failed Meta ad create (`POST /v1/ads/create`, `POST /v1/ads/boost`,
`POST /v1/ads/ctwa`) carries `stage`, `adAccountId` and `createdObjects`: where
it failed, on which ad account, and every object this request had already
created with what cleanup did to it. `left_behind` objects still exist on the
ad account (Meta refused the delete, typically on a held account), so delete
them yourself or reuse them. `unconfirmedWrite` is set when Meta answered a
create with a 5xx or dropped the connection and Zernio could not confirm
whether the object exists: check that parent before creating it again.

When Meta refuses a write because the ad account's status is ineligible to manage
ads (Meta subcode 2490592 or 4841021, on the write itself or on a cleanup delete),
any Meta ads write (create, boost, CTWA, campaign / ad set / ad updates and status
changes) answers 422 `ad_account_unusable`. The message names the ad account when
known, links Meta's fix (https://www.facebook.com/business/help/422289316306981),
lists the objects left behind and ends with Meta's original error, which also stays
verbatim in `platformError`. Meta often reports the first failure under an
unrelated code (e.g. 1487194 on the creative), so branch on `code`, not on
`platformError`.

  - **stage** `string`: Meta ad create failures only. The step that failed: `media` (image/video download or upload), `campaign`, `adset`, `creative`, `ad` (the ad POST itself, where Meta's code 31 / 3858385 hold and 100 / 1359188 payment rejections land), `activation` (switching the created objects on), or `other` (a read or check before any write). - one of: media, campaign, adset, creative, ad, activation, other
  - **adAccountId** `string`: Meta ad create failures only. The ad account the request wrote to (`act_...`).
  - **createdObjects** `array`: Meta ad create failures only. Every object this request created before failing, in creation order. Objects you referenced (an existing campaign, ad set, creative or video) are never listed and never deleted.
  - **unconfirmedWrite** `object`: Meta ad create failures only, when Meta answered a create with a 5xx or dropped the connection and the object could not be looked up. Zernio did not retry it.
  - **quotaExhausted** `boolean`: Google Ads 429 only. True when the upstream Google Ads quota is spent rather than a Zernio limit.
  - **quotaScope** `string`: Google Ads 429 only, when Google names the scope. DEVELOPER is the shared developer-token budget; ACCOUNT is your ad account. - one of: DEVELOPER, ACCOUNT
  - **budgetScope** `string`: Zernio Google Ads burst-limit 429 only (never set alongside `quotaExhausted`). `account` is the limit of 15 requests per minute per connected Google Ads account; `user` is the ceiling of 120 requests per minute per Zernio user across all their Google Ads accounts. Both clear within a minute. - one of: account, user
